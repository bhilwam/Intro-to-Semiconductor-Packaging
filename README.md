üì¶ Why is Semiconductor Packaging needed?
Semiconductor chips comprising of extremely small components, are manufactured at a very controlled and protected environment. Semiconductor packaging is crucial for transferring a fragile, fabricated silicon die from a controlled, cleanroom environment to the real-world electronics. Since bare dies from foundries like Intel, TSMC, or Samsung are delicate, packaging protects them from moisture, physical damage, and other environmental factors allowing them to function properly in electronic devices.
üõ°Ô∏è Key Functions of Packaging
Protection of the semiconductor devices on the die from physical damage, moisture, dust, and corrosion, ensuring the die remains safe during handling, transport, and operation
Electrical Connectivity (pins, balls, or leads) that link the chip to the rest of the system, enabling power and data transfer
Thermal Management by dissipating heat generated by the chip during operation, preventing overheating and ensuring optimal performance and longevity These functions together enable the semiconductor chip to operate effectively and reliably in real-world devices.
üß† Real-World Example
A real-world example of semiconductor packaging can be found in smartphones. Let‚Äôs take the Apple A-series chip packaging (e.g., A14, A15, A16 Bionic), commonly used in iPhones. The A-series chip is packaged in a System in Package (SiP) configuration. The chip package has small solder balls underneath (in this case, a Ball Grid Array (BGA) configuration) that connect the chip to the motherboard of the phone. These solder balls create the electrical links that allow the chip to communicate with other components like memory, sensors, and the display. So, the semiconductor packaging in the Apple A-series chip ensures the chip is protected, connected, thermally managed, mechanically stable, and reliable‚Äîallowing the phone to function at high performance while enduring real-world conditions. This same concept applies to many other devices, including computers, tablets, and wearables.

üè≠ Semiconductor Industry Segments
A semiconductor ecosystem is an entire network of industries, technologies, companies, and processes involved in the creation, manufacturing, and deployment of semiconductor devices. It includes everything from the raw materials used to make semiconductors, to the research and development (R&D) efforts that push innovation, to the manufacturing and packaging processes that bring chips into the real world, and finally, the industries and applications that use these chips.
Fabless companies are semiconductor companies that design and develop chips but do not have their own manufacturing facilities (known as fabs). Instead, they outsource the actual manufacturing (or "fabrication") of their chips to third-party foundries, also known as contract manufacturers or semiconductor fabs. This model allows fabless companies to focus on chip design and innovation without the enormous capital investment required for semiconductor fabrication. Example: Qualcomm, AMD, NVIDIA, etc.
Foundries produce integrated circuits (ICs) based on designs provided by other companies, known as fabless companies. Foundries do not design chips themselves but focus on the production process, which involves transforming raw materials (such as silicon) into functional semiconductor components using advanced manufacturing techniques. Example: TSMC, Samsung, etc.
OSAT stands for Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test. It refers to companies that specialize in the assembly (packaging) and testing of semiconductor devices, but do not engage in the actual fabrication of the semiconductor chips themselves. This sector ensures that the chips are properly enclosed (packaged) to protect them from environmental factors and ready them for integration into electronic devices. Additionally, testing is crucial to verify that each chip functions as intended, meets quality standards, and is free from defects. Example: ASE Group, Amkor Technology, JCET Group, etc.
IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer) companies design, manufacture, assemble, and test their own semiconductor devices. This vertical integration allows IDMs to have full control over their product quality, cost, and production timelines. Example: Intel

### Understanding Package Requirements and Foundational Package Types

![Screenshot 2025-04-19 234937](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec858096-0ab0-4f00-9283-bddd60b6a83b)


üìå Package Requirements
In System on Chip (SoC) design, selecting the appropriate package plays a vital role in achieving optimal reliability, efficiency, and performance. As illustrated below, the package serves as a critical interface between the chip and the board, maintaining electrical, thermal, and mechanical integrity.

The chip is mounted on a package, which in turn is placed on the board. The key question is: how do we choose the right package?
One major factor is üîå electrical connectivity ‚Äî the package must be capable of interfacing effectively with other packages on the board. If high-speed communication is required, sufficient pin count or interconnects must be supported to meet design needs.
Another critical aspect is üå°Ô∏è thermal requirements. The package must manage heat efficiently. For instance, if the system is expected to operate at very high temperatures (e.g., above 200¬∞C), standard laminate-based packages may not suffice; ceramic or other high thermal performance materials would be more appropriate. This makes the choice of substrate a crucial consideration.
Form factor also plays a role ‚Äî the physical space available for the package on the board can influence the design.
Durability and long-term reliability üîÑ are equally important, both of which are heavily influenced by the materials used in the package.
And finally, perhaps the most important factor in any real-world design ‚Äî cost üí≤. The selected package must strike the right balance between performance, reliability, and budget.
üß± Typical Package Structure
The image below illustrates the internal structure of a typical package and the connectivity.

To understand the basic structure of a semiconductor package, let‚Äôs start with the die. The die is first mounted onto a substrate (or sometimes a carrier), establishing the initial connection through small bond wires or bumps. The substrate provides mechanical support, electrical connectivity, and thermal management. It can be made from materials like ceramic, organic laminates, or metal cores, depending on the application. Once the die is secured to the carrier, the next step is to connect the carrier to the PCB. Finally, a molding compound is applied around the assembly for protection. This material, often a type of epoxy or plastic, serves to protect the delicate components from environmental factors (e.g., moisture, dust) and mechanical stress.
There are two primary mounting technologies used in this process.
Through-Hole Mounting (THM): one of the older methods, where the component leads (pins) pass through holes in the PCB and are soldered to pads on the opposite side. Holes are drilled into the PCB where the leads of the package will go. The leads of the component are inserted into these holes. The leads are soldered on the opposite side of the PCB, creating electrical connections.
Surface Mount Technology (SMT): involves mounting electronic components directly onto the surface of a PCB, where the component leads are soldered to the surface-mounted pads (instead of being inserted through holes). This is done using automated machinery and solder paste.

### Evolving Package Architectures from Single-chip to Multi-chip modules
üì¶ Anatomy of Packages
Understanding the anatomy of a semiconductor package is essential for evaluating its performance in terms of electrical connectivity, thermal behavior, mechanical durability, and manufacturability. The specific implementation of each element can vary depending on package type, application, and design constraints, but the fundamental structure remains consistent across most modern packages.
Leadframe-Based Packages
A leadframe is a thin sheet of metal (typically copper or copper alloy) stamped or etched to form:
- Die pad: A central area where the silicon die is mounted.
- Leads: Metal fingers extending outward that serve as electrical paths from the die to the external PCB.
‚öôÔ∏è Basic Structure of a Leadframe Package
1. Silicon Die: Placed on the die pad of the leadframe.
2. Die Attach: The die is attached to the pad using adhesive or solder.
3. Wire Bonds: Gold or copper wires connect the die‚Äôs bond pads to the leads of the frame.
4. Encapsulation: The assembly is molded in epoxy resin to protect the internal elements.
5. Leads: The outer portion of the metal frame extends beyond the molding compound to allow surface mounting or through-hole soldering.
üì¶ Common Leadframe-Based Package Types
DIP (Dual In-line Package) Rectangular body with two rows of through-hole leads. Used in older devices and through-hole boards.
SOP (Small Outline Package) Surface-mount version of DIP with shorter, gull-wing leads.
SSOP / TSSOP (Shrink/Thin SOP) More compact versions of SOP for higher pin density.
QFP (Quad Flat Package) Four-sided surface-mount package with fine-pitch leads on all sides.
LQFP (Low-profile QFP) Thinner version of QFP for compact applications.
QFN (Quad Flat No-lead) Exposed pad package without leads; pads are on the bottom for better thermal and electrical performance.
DFN (Dual Flat No-lead) Like QFN but with pads only on two sides. Very compact.
‚úÖ Advantages of Leadframe Packages
- Cost-Effective: Simple to manufacture, suitable for high-volume production.
- Mature Technology: Well-established, with proven reliability.
- Good Electrical Performance: Low parasitic inductance for many applications.
- Scalable: Available in a wide range of pin counts and sizes.
- Thermal Options: Versions like QFN with exposed thermal pads provide better heat dissipation.
‚ùå Limitations
- Limited I/O Density: Compared to advanced packaging (e.g., BGA or flip-chip).
- Thermal and Electrical Performance: May not meet requirements for very high-performance systems.
- Size: Leaded versions (like DIP and SOP) can be bulky compared to modern alternatives.
üí° Applications of Leadframe Packages
- Consumer electronics
- Automotive electronics
- Power management ICs
- Microcontrollers (MCUs)
- Analog/mixed-signal ICs
- LED packages

Laminate-Based Packages
A laminate-based package uses a multi-layer organic substrate (similar to a mini PCB) instead of a metal leadframe to support the die and route electrical signals. These packages enable high I/O density, fine pitch, and multilayer routing, making them ideal for advanced applications like processors, memory, and high-speed interfaces.
üì¶ Common Laminate-Based Package Types
Wire Bond PBGA (Plastic Ball Grid Array) Die is connected via wirebonds to a laminated substrate with solder balls for board attachment.
Flip Chip PBGA Die is flipped and directly bonded to the substrate using solder bumps, improving performance and reducing parasitics.
LGA (Land Grid Array) No solder balls; flat contacts for direct PCB connection.
‚úÖ Advantages of Laminate Packages
- High I/O Density: Supports fine pitch and many interconnects.
- Multilayer Routing: Embedded traces and vias allow complex signal routing.
- Better Electrical Performance: Lower parasitics compared to leadframes.
-Compact Form Factor: Smaller footprint with surface-mount capabilities.
-Good Thermal Paths: Can include thermal vias or spreaders.
‚ùå Challenges / Limitations
- More Expensive: Higher material and fabrication cost than leadframe packages.
- Sensitive to Moisture: Requires careful handling and moisture control (MSL).
- Complex Assembly: Requires precise alignment and reflow soldering.
üí° Applications
- Microprocessors and high-speed ASICs
- DRAM and Flash memory
- Networking and telecom ICs
- High-performance FPGAs
- Mobile and consumer electronics

Advanced package substrates
Advanced substrates are high-performance materials and structures used in semiconductor packaging to support high I/O count, high-speed signal integrity, power delivery, and thermal management ‚Äî especially in cutting-edge devices like processors, FPGAs, GPUs, and AI accelerators. Unlike traditional laminate or leadframe substrates, advanced substrates are engineered with fine line/space, multi-layer interconnects, embedded passives, and CTE-matched materials to support modern system demands.
2D: Multiple dies placed side by side on a single substrate (FCBGA). FCBGA (Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array) is a high-performance semiconductor packaging technology that combines the benefits of flip-chip die attach with a laminate substrate and ball grid array for board-level connections.
2.1D: Similar to 2D but includes an RDL (Redistribution Layer) to improve routing and integration.
2.3D: Uses an organic interposer to connect dies.
2.5D: Uses a silicon interposer for high-speed interconnects between dies, such as in CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate). üìå Example: CoWoS (2.5D) TSMC CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) integrates a silicon interposer with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and a logic SoC on a common substrate. This design supports advanced applications such as AI and HPC (High-Performance Computing).

### Interposers Redistribution layers and 3D Packaging Approaches
1. Redistribution Layers (RDL)
üîç What is RDL?
RDL (Redistribution Layer) is a metal layer added on top of a die or wafer to reroute the I/O pads to new locations. This enables more flexible bump layouts, especially important for fan-out packages or wafer-level chip scale packaging (WLCSP).
üí° Applications
- Fan-out wafer-level packaging (FO-WLP, FO-BGA)
- Panel-level packaging (PLP)
- Multi-die integration
- System-in-Package (SiP)
‚úÖ Advantages:
- Allows larger bump pitch for finer pad layouts
- Reduces package size and thickness
- Enables multi-chip placement and interconnect on a single substrate
2. Interposers
üîç What is an Interposer?
An interposer is a passive or active layer inserted between the die and the substrate, acting as an intermediate routing interface. It enables dense signal routing, power delivery, and die-to-die interconnect.
Types: Silicon, Organic, Glass
‚úÖ Functions:
- Routes signals between multiple dies (e.g., chiplets)
- Provides thermal expansion management
- Enables high bandwidth communication
üß† Passive vs. Active Interposers:
- Passive: No logic, just routing and vias
- Active: Includes power delivery, clocking, or even memory logic
3. 2.5D/3D Integration
2.5D: Multiple dies (e.g., CPU + HBM) placed side-by-side on a common interposer. Interposer provides connectivity, not the substrate directly. Popular in HPC and AI (e.g., AMD Instinct, NVIDIA GPUs with HBM).
3D: Dies are stacked vertically, interconnected through Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). 3D NAND, HBM memory stacks, logic-on-logic stacking.
üßæ Comparison Table


### Comparative Analysis and Selecting the right Packaging Solution
Below is a clean, structured comparative Analysis of packaging technologies, followed by a guideline to selecting the right packaging solution.


Choosing the right semiconductor packaging depends on multiple factors across performance, reliability, form factor, and cost. Below is a structured approach:
üõ†Ô∏è 1. Define System Requirements - like I/o count, die size, speed, bandwidth, thermal load etc.
üß™ 2. Match with Package Capabilities - needs like low cost, high performance compute, high bandwidth memory, space constraints etc.
üí° 3. Consider Cost vs. Performance Trade-offs - If cost is the primary driver, leadframe-based packages such as QFN or SOP, or standard BGA options, offer a cost-effective solution. For applications where performance is critical, advanced options like FCBGA, RDL-based packaging, or interposer-enabled designs are more suitable. In scenarios requiring ultra-compact form factors, fan-out wafer-level packaging (WLP) or 3D TSV-based packages provide optimal space efficiency. Lastly, for designs targeting future scalability, such as chiplet architectures or modular systems, 2.5D and 3D packaging approaches are ideal due to their flexibility and high integration capability
üîç 4. Evaluate Manufacturing and Supply Chain Constraints - Substrate availability, ensuring compatibility with existing assembly and test processes, strong ecosystem support from suppliers, including OSATs (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test providers), substrate manufacturers, and foundry packaging services

Introduction to a Package Manufacturing Unit (ATMP)
The ATMP process involves four core activities: Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging.
üè≠ Where is ATMP Performed?
Major ATMP Hubs:
ASEAN region: Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines
East Asia: Taiwan, China, South Korea

Wafer pre-preparation: Grinding and Dicing
This section outlines the sequence of steps involved in the wafer preparation process inside an ISO Class 7 cleanroom of an ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging) facility. Cleanrooms are essential for maintaining strict control over dust, particles, temperature, humidity, and electrostatic discharge, especially during sensitive semiconductor assembly steps.
üßº Activities Inside the Cleanroom (Class 1000‚Äì10000)

Wafers enter the cleanroom in protective carriers to avoid contamination. Before packaging, the wafers‚Äîtypically 12-inch and around 700‚Äì800 microns thick‚Äîmust be thinned since only the front side contains circuitry, while the backside is structural. The process begins with wafer inspection and testing, followed by front-side protection using lamination. The wafer is then flipped and back grinding is performed to reduce thickness, which introduces mechanical stress and must be carefully managed to avoid breakage. After grinding, a tape frame is applied to the wafer, and dicing is done using either blade or laser methods (laser preferred). The individual chips are then ready for packaging.
A Look Inside - Amkor Manufacturing
Wire Bond Packaging: Die attach to Molding
Wire bonding is a method used to create electrical connections between the silicon die and the package leads or substrate using fine metal wires. It is a mature, cost-effective, and reliable technology, widely used in a variety of packages including QFN, SOP, and even some BGA formats.
HB100 Automatic Wire Bonder - Bond Modes

üì¶ Wire Bond Packaging Process ‚Äì Step-by-Step
Start with a Diced Wafer


The wafer has already been cut into individual dies (chips)
Die Selection & Placement (Die Attach)


Select a good die from the wafer
Place the die onto a substrate (either laminate-based or leadframe)
Apply Die Attach Film or Epoxy


Dispense adhesive (typically epoxy, acting like glue) onto the substrate
The die is then placed onto the adhesive
Curing


Cure the epoxy to secure the die and relieve mechanical stress
Curing is done using thermal ovens or UV light
Wire Bonding


Create electrical connections between the die and the substrate using fine metal wires (gold, copper, or aluminum)
Wire bonding acts like "flyovers" to bridge the die pads to package terminals
Molding / Encapsulation


Encapsulate the die and wires with a plastic mold compound for mechanical protection
Marking


Mark the package with identifying information (e.g., part number, lot code) for traceability
Singulation (Dicing)


The final packaged units, typically processed in panels or arrays, are separated (singulated) using a dicing blade
This step cuts out the individual packages from the molded array
‚úÖ Notes:
Wire bonding is a cost-effective and widely used packaging technique. It‚Äôs preferred in many applications due to its simplicity, flexibility, and low cost.
Flip Chip Assembly: Bump Formation and Underfill
Flip Chip packaging is an advanced method of connecting the die to the substrate face-down, using solder bumps placed directly on the die‚Äôs I/O pads. Unlike wire bonding, which uses wires to make connections from the top of the die, flip chip offers shorter, more efficient interconnects, enabling higher performance and smaller form factors.



üîß Flip Chip Packaging Process ‚Äì Step-by-Step
Bump Formation


Solder bumps (e.g., SnAgCu) or microbumps are formed on the die pads
Techniques include electroplating, solder paste printing, or stud bumping
Wafer-Level Testing & Dicing
The bumped wafer is tested and then diced into individual dies

Mass Reflow and Thermo-compression process
Die Placement (Flipping the chip)
The die is flipped face-down and aligned so the bumps face the substrate
It is placed directly on metal pads of the substrate or interposer, which already have some bond pad and flux. Flux is an environment to protect the metal from oxidation.
Solder reflow
The entire assembly is heated in a reflow oven
Solder bumps melt and solidify to form strong electrical and mechanical joints
The process is a mix of heat and pressure to connect the pads adequately
Reflow is a process important from reliability dtandpoint
Flux cleansing - remove the previously applied fill not need anymore.
Underfill Application
Primary job - to mitigate/reduce stress - CTE(coefficient of thermal expansion )
An underfill epoxy is dispensed between the die and substrate to enhance reliability
It prevents mechanical stress and improves thermal cycling performance
Underfill Cure - curing the underfill by heat to lock it in place
Molding / Encapsulation (if needed)
Some flip-chip packages are molded, especially for consumer and mobile applications
Marking and Ball mounting on the substrate 
To connect to the outside world from the substrate (filp the package)
Final Testing and Singulation
The completed packages undergo electrical testing, X-ray inspection, and are then singulated if processed in panel format

Wafer Level Packaging And Conclusion
Wafer-Level Packaging is a technique where the entire packaging process is done at the wafer level, before dicing. Unlike traditional methods that package individual dies after dicing, WLP processes all chips while still on the wafer, resulting in smaller size, lower cost, and higher performance. For mobile applications where we want the chip to be as small as possible

There are two main types:
Fan-In WLP ‚Äì Interconnects remain within the die footprint
Fan-Out WLP (FOWLP) ‚Äì Interconnects extend beyond the die, enabling more I/Os



üîß Wafer-Level Packaging Process ‚Äì Step-by-Step [Reconstitution process
Dies places closed to each other 
üì¶ Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging (FOWLP) ‚Äì Key Features & Process Highlights
Flip Chip Orientation
The die is placed face-down (flipped) and embedded in EMC (Epoxy Molding Compound)
No Traditional Package Substrate
Unlike conventional flip chip, no laminate substrate is used
Redistribution Layer (RDL)
An interconnecting metal layer (RDL) is built over the molded wafer
It reroutes the die‚Äôs I/O to external solder balls
Routing on RDL Instead of Laminate
In flip chip with laminate, routing is done via laminate vias
In FOWLP, all routing is handled by the RDL, adding design complexity
RDL similar to BEOL stack 
Size Reduction Benefit
Despite the complexity, the absence of a substrate allows for a much smaller package footprint
Reconstitution Process


Instead of attaching the die to a substrate, multiple dies are placed on a temporary carrier, close together
The entire array is molded to form a reconstituted wafer
Post-Mold RDL Formation


After molding, RDL layers are fabricated on the flat surface to complete electrical connections
Initial dielectric and metal layers are deposited on the reconstituted wafer
Multiple RDL layers are patterned for interconnection routing
Solder balls are mounted on the final RDL pads to enable surface mounting
Carrier Removal & Dicing


The carrier is removed, and the molded wafer is diced into packages

Ensuring Package Reliability: Testing and Performance Validation
Introduction to Package Testing and Electrical Functionality Checks
Testing at Different Stages
Testing is performed at multiple stages in the semiconductor lifecycle to ensure functionality, yield, and reliability ‚Äî from the wafer level to final product delivery. Testing is conducted at both the Foundry and OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) levels.



üè≠ Foundry Testing Stages
Front-End Manufacturing


Involves wafer fabrication and creation of integrated circuits on silicon wafers.
Process development ensures quality control and high-yield production.
Wafer Probe Test


Use a probe station and ATE (Automated Test Equipment).
Each die is tested by contacting the pads/bump sites using a probe card.
üß™ OSAT Testing Stage
Package Manufacturing


Functional dies are packaged using techniques like:
Die bonding
Wire or flip-chip bonding
Encapsulation
Package Testing


Conducted in ISO Class 6/7 cleanroom zones.
Testing includes:
AOST (Assembly Open and Short Test): Quick check for opens/shorts in packages.



Burn-in: Applies voltage and temperature stress to catch early failures. Devices are exposed to high temperature and voltage to accelerate aging.
Final Test: Functional and parametric testing across temperature ranges. Post-Packaging Functional Test performed using Automated Test Equipment (ATE). Full chip functionality, I/O operation and signal timing, Power consumption and leakage are all tested.
System-Level Test (SLT)


Performed in a real or emulated end-user environment
Example: Testing an SoC inside a phone board simulation
Checks interactions with memory, sensors, I/O, etc.
Purpose: Capture failures that ATE may miss (e.g., timing marginalities, real-world power issues)
Reliability and Performance Testing of Semiconductor Packages
Burn-in, Final Test, and ATE Overview
This section provides an overview of various stages involved in the testing of integrated circuits (ICs), focusing on Burn-in Testing, Final Testing, and the use of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE).


üî• Burn-In Test
Burn-in testing is a reliability screening process where semiconductor devices are exposed to elevated temperatures, voltages, and operating conditions for an extended period to accelerate aging and failure mechanisms. It is used to identify and eliminate early-life failures (also called "infant mortality") in ICs before they are shipped to end users. Observed failure rate - Bath tub curve, 

üéØ Purpose of Burn-In Testing
Detect latent manufacturing defects
Improve long-term product reliability
Ensure performance under extreme conditions
Qualify devices for mission-critical applications
üîÅ Typical Test Conditions:
Temperature 125¬∞C to 150¬∞C (sometimes higher)
Voltage 1.5√ó to 2√ó normal operating voltage
Duration 24 to 168 hours (1‚Äì7 days)
Environment Controlled chamber or oven with power applied
‚úîÔ∏è Common in:
Automotive-grade ICs (AEC-Q100 compliance)
Medical electronics
Aerospace and defense
Enterprise-grade processors and FPGAs
‚ùå Less common in:
Consumer electronics (phones, laptops) due to cost and time constraints

‚úÖ Final Test (FT) ‚Äì Semiconductor Testing After Packaging
Final Test is the last major electrical test phase after the semiconductor die has been packaged. It verifies that the packaged device meets all functional, parametric, and performance specifications before it is shipped to customers. It is typically performed by OSATs (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test providers) or in-house test facilities.
Test flow:
Device Loading


Packaged ICs are loaded into automated test handlers.
Handlers place each device into a test socket.
ATE Interface

Package Design and Modeling: Building a Semiconductor Package from Scratch
Introduction to Package Cross-Section Modeling in ANSYS Electronics Desktop
The objective is to create package cross-section in ANSYS AEDT. This lab focuses on designing a semiconductor wire bond package from scratch using Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT). The complete cross-section of a wire bond package, including die, substrate, bonding wires, and mold compound is modeled.
Package Manufacturing Flow:
üßæ 1. Wafer Reception - Fully processed wafer (typically 200 mm or 300 mm) from the foundry. Wafer ID, surface condition, and warpage are checked. Wafer is stored in Front Opening Unified Pods (FOUPs) or cassettes to avoid contamination.
üîç 2. Wafer Backgrinding - Reduce wafer thickness to meet package size constraints. Front side is laminated with protective tape. Backside grinding reduces thickness.
‚úÇÔ∏è 3. Wafer Dicing / Singulation - Separate the wafer into individual dies (chips) by Blade dicing (mechanical) or Laser grooving + breaking (preferred for small pitches).
üîó 4. Die Attach - Attach each die to a substrate or leadframe using methods like Epoxy dispensing or die attach film (DAF). Die is cured via thermal or UV process.
üîå 5. Interconnect / Die-to-Package Connection - Two main technologies: Wire Bonding (Wires (Au, Cu, or Al) connect die pads to package leads, Common in QFN, SOP, and some BGA packages) & Flip-Chip Bonding (Die is flipped; solder bumps on die connect directly to the substrate, Used in FCBGA, WLCSP, 2.5D/3D ICs).
üß± 6. Encapsulation / Molding - Protect the die and wires with Epoxy Molding Compound (EMC).
‚úíÔ∏è 7. Marking - Laser or ink marking is applied to the top of the package used to identify Lot number, Product ID, Manufacturing code, Traceability code etc..
ü™ì 8. Package Singulation (Post-Mold Dicing) - Multiple packaged dies on a strip are singulated into individual units. Dicing saw or laser is used to cut molded panels.
üß™ 9. Final Test / Electrical Testing - Packaged ICs are tested using ATE systems. Devices are binned and sorted.
üì¶ 10. Packing & Shipping - Devices are packed in JEDEC trays, tape-and-reel, or bulk. Labeled with date code, lot ID, and destination details. Ready for shipment to OEMs or ODMs.



Why Package 3D cross section is needed ?

Thermal analysis is just one aspect of evaluating a package‚Äôs overall performance. Equally important is electrical performance, which plays a critical role during the package design phase. Tools like ANSYS Q3D Extractor and Maxwell are commonly used for electrical analysis in this context. However, in this lab, the primary focus will be on building the package structure from the ground up, rather than conducting in-depth electrical or thermal simulations.
Creating the Die and Substrate in AEDT
üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create a Die in ANSYS
Step 1. Launch ANSYS Electronics Desktop (AEDT)
Choose a project type: Icepak, HFSS 3D Layout, or Q3D Extractor for die
Create a new project and insert a new design (e.g., Icepak for thermal, HFSS for EM)
Define the Working Units: Go to Modeler ‚Üí Units
Set units to mm (or Œºm) for package-scale modeling

 Step 2. Create the Die Geometry
Use Draw ‚Üí Rectangle to create the die (chip)
Set the dimensions as 3mm x 3mm and the positions (0,0,0) for center
For thickness, apply 0.2mm (after thinning). Modeler -> Surface -> Thicken Sheet and set the thickness as 0.2mm
Check Material -> SIlicon 
Pro Tip: Name it clearly (e.g., Die) 
Note - HBM are connected by TSV and are very very thin typically ~ 30microns. General die size ~15um x15um to 20um x20um



Step 3: Assign Material Properties
Go to Modeler ‚Üí Assign Material
Choose Silicon from the material library (or create a custom material)
Assign it to the die geometry

Final die structure


üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create a Substrate in ANSYS
Step 4. Create the Substrate Geometry
Create another rectangle for the substrate (e.g., 5mm x 5mm)
Position the substrate such that the die is at the center (e.g., -1, -1, -0.1) z space for die attachment between
Modeler -> Surface -> Thicken Sheet and set the thickness as -0.5mm (0.5mm would hide the die, in order to put substrate on bottom of die -0.5mm)
Material -> FR4_Epoxy







The space between the die and substrate in the below figure is for die attach material.

Adding Die Attach Material and Bond Pads
üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create a Die Attach Material
Step 5: Create the DAM Geometry
Create another rectangle same size as die at origin (0,0,0) to represent die attach epoxy
Set thickness: -0.1 mm
Assign appropriate material such as modified_epoxy for thermal conductivity simulation







üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create Bond Pads
Step 6: Define Die Pads
Create a thin rectangle to represent the die pad of dimensions 0.2mm x 0.2mm
Set thickness: 0.005 mm
Similarly create pads on the substrate


Step 7: Create bond pads on both die and substrate
Create the pads across the periphery of the die and substrate as shown in the below figure
These will serve as connection points
Assign material (typically metal types like copper, gold or aluminum)

Wire Bond Creation and Material Assignment
üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create Bond Wires
Step 8: Connect pads using wires
Draw -> Bondwire
Connect the die pads to substrate pads using gold wire





Applying Mold Compound and Finalizing the Package Model
üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create Mold Compound
Step 9: Build mold around the die
Add a rectangular mold compound to encapsulate the die and wire bonds
Set thickness: 1.2 mm
Assign mold material (e.g., epoxy molding compound)


Step 10: Post molding, attach solder balls. Define power dissipation for the die and Set boundary conditions. Set up mesh operations and run simulation (thermal or EM). Visualize temperature distribution, current density, or EM fields
Conclusion: Semiconductor Packaging
Semiconductor packaging is no longer just about protecting the chip‚Äîit's a key factor in enabling performance, reliability, and integration. As device complexity increases, packaging must meet demanding electrical, thermal, and form-factor requirements. From traditional leadframe designs to advanced solutions like FCBGA, 2.5D/3D, and wafer-level packaging, the choice of package plays a strategic role in product success.
With the rise of chiplets, heterogeneous integration, and shrinking form factors, packaging is now a vital part of the innovation pipeline‚Äîbridging the gap between silicon design and system performance.
